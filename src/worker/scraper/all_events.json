Triple 3  V is a nonprofit organization dedicated to shining light on enterprising, resilient, and creative students. Unlike other student advocacy organizations that solely focus on academia, they spotlight a variety of fields. Through their scholarship opportunities, mentorships, and leadership summits, they help motivate students while celebrating their successes. \n\nThe \"Triple V Me\" initiative provides a platform for students to share their impactful stories. Students who excel in academics, arts, community work, entrepreneurship, and sports give first-hand accounts of how they've overcome adversity and challenges head-on to get where they are. 20 of these inspiring students will be eligible to receive a scholarship of up to $3,000 to honor their tales of perseverance. \n\n\"Triple V Community\" is a project that focuses on cultivating a sense of community and promoting cultural exchange between American and Ukrainian students. It aims to create a space for Ukrainian students to connect with American students who can aid in the acclimation process. In order to encourage leadership and networking, monthly meetings will be held, featuring fun activities, guest speakers, and student led discussion.  \n\nIf anyone is interested in any of these opportunities, please fill out this form (https://forms.gle/2teeNDBXk2hv9ruF8) to attend our meeting on Saturday at 1:00 pm on October 14th at M.O.M.S. cafe. If you cannot attend in person, we will have a zoom at the same time for people to join. The zoom link will be posted before the event. For further information feel free to check out the Triple 3 V website (https://www.triple3v.org/) or contact us through one of our platforms and we will do our best to answer your questions.",

I've made the decision to graduate early during this Winter Quarter and will be studying abroad. For situations such as these in the future, I'd like to suggest a constitutional amendment specifically addressing situations like mine, where a member cannot complete a full term but wishes to avoid leaving their position vacant. We are planning to make a minor amendment to the club constitution, and for all active club members, you are guaranteed the right to vote on this change.\n\nIn accordance with \u201cSection 9.2: Voting on an Amendment\u201d, I am initiating a quorum of\nall currently participating members of the UCSD Kendo Club to vote on this \namendment. Current active club members are defined as those who regularly engage in club\nactivities, attend practices, and pay dues as required. Should the proposed amendment garner the approval of a simple majority of the active Club members present, we will implement the proposed amendment \"Section 6.4: Role Sharing.\" In the event that a simple majority of votes in favor is not achieved,the amendment will be deemed null and void.\n\nThe voting period will be open from 8:00 PM on October 4, 2023, to 8:00 PM on October 5,\n2023. Go to this link: https://forms.gle/hjScxWwHojQh4uhx8\nto submit your anonymous response. Use your UCSD account. Thank you!\n\nThe proposed amendment, \"Section 6.4: Role Sharing\u201d, is highlighted in red under \u201cArticle VI: Elections\u201d:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNSw11UoijXoyqhy-JKV_GLG6mZu6zw9zB_k-D7iPLs/\nedit?usp=sharing",

Today\u2019s workshop will cover the blueprint of a ML workflow, different places to access free datasets, what Sagemaker is, my favorite ML tools in Sagemaker, and creating a simple wine quality model using Sagemaker\n\n3. This workshop will be more technical than the last workshop, where all we really did was set up your AWS account and cover the basics of remote access and file transfer. You don\u2019t have to follow along on your own laptop if you feel like you will be overwhelmed. If you do want to follow along, there is a PDF called DS3-WS2-PreWork.pdf. Please try and complete this before coming to the workshop today. \n\n4. If you didn\u2019t attend the last workshop and need help creating an AWS account, you can follow the steps in the slides for WS1 which I have attached. \n\nThank you and hopefully I\u2019ll see you there!",
