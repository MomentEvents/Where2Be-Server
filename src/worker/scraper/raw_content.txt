How are research labs tinkering with electronics to make brain signal acquisition feasible with something as comfortable as your earphones? With this event, we'll be spotlighting the active cluster of neurotechnology related research at UCSD! \n> Lab PI’s, Graduate Students, and Undergrads will be joining us from two labs (NEATLab and ISN). NeatLab will focus on machine learning techniques and/or animal models to advance the field of neurocognition. ISN will focus on hardware design that is used to collect EEG data and process neural signals. Together, the research presented will take you through the process of how neural signals can be used to read mental health state and what kinds of new hardware are being developed to make this type of data collection more accessible.\n> \n> We will also have undergraduates from both labs to talk about their experiences, which is a great chance for you to learn about getting involved in UCSD lab and research as an undergrad!\n> \n> So be sure to drop by, learn some cool research, and make some new connections to start a new lab position! \uD83D\uDE42\n> \n> https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/9754290712\n> Meeting ID: 975 429 0712",
